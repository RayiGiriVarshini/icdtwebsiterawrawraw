        <p>The programme aims to provide 'IC Design and Manufacturing' specialists trained in the concepts and techniques of Fabless Chip Design and manufacturing, contributing significantly towards making India a Semiconductor Nation. Furthermore, the programme intends to provide summer and semester-long industry internships to students to adapt to the market's demand. Objective of this program to provide end-to-end learning to the student so that they can be industry ready when they're getting graduated. Apart from fundamentals taught in first two years, the student will be going to go deep in either IC design stream or IC manufacturing stream. Summer internship and semester-long industry internship make a very big value added to the student. With the announcement of design-linked incentive scheme under the Semicondactor Policy of Government of India, which aims to support 100 start-ups in the area of Semicondactor design. The new course by IT Hyderabad is crafted to not only bring academics to India closer to industry requirements, but also pave the way for making India a semiconductor nation. India is moving in the direction of setting up semiconductor fabs in the country so that India can become not only a global player, but also a leader in the semiconductor manufacturing and product development.
