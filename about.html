IIT Hyderabad has started taking a number of steps, and one such step is a new BTech program. I am very confident that this program will attract a large number of students and will be a key player in developing the human resources for the world in the field of IC design and manufacturing.
                Tape out of chip design and hands-on training in semiconductor fabrication labs are the major USPs of this program,” Shiv Govind Singh, head, department of electrical engineering, said.
            </p>
            <p class="divs" style="margin-top:20px;">
        "The Bachelor of Electrical Engineering Course with specialisation in IC Design and Technology of IIT Hyderabad is being initiated just at the right time. The course curriculum focusing on creating industry-ready design designers at the undergraduate level is a welcome move to make India a global talent hub in the ssemiconductor design area,” Sunita Verma, Scientist 'G' and Group Coordinator (R&D in Electronics and IT), Meity, said.</p>
        <p class="divs" style="margin-top:20px;"> "Government of India has announced Semiconductor India Programme for manufacturing and display ecosystem in the country. I'm happy to learn that IITH has launched a B.Tech course for manufacturing and design. Such courses will go a long way in making India to make it a semi-conductor nation train professionals in “IC Design and Manufacturing” the principles and methods of fabless chip design and manufacturing, making contribution to India becoming a semiconductor nation." Mr. Amitesh Sinha, Joint Secretary Electronics, Meity, said.

        <p>The programme aims to provide 'IC Design and Manufacturing' specialists trained in the concepts and techniques of Fabless Chip Design and manufacturing, contributing significantly towards making India a Semiconductor Nation. Furthermore, the programme intends to provide summer and semester-long industry internships to students to adapt to the market's demand. Objective of this program to provide end-to-end learning to the student so that they can be industry ready when they're getting graduated. Apart from fundamentals taught in first two years, the student will be going to go deep in either IC design stream or IC manufacturing stream. Summer internship and semester-long industry internship make a very big value added to the student. With the announcement of design-linked incentive scheme under the Semicondactor Policy of Government of India, which aims to support 100 start-ups in the area of Semicondactor design. The new course by IT Hyderabad is crafted to not only bring academics to India closer to industry requirements, but also pave the way for making India a semiconductor nation. India is moving in the direction of setting up semiconductor fabs in the country so that India can become not only a global player, but also a leader in the semiconductor manufacturing and product development.
